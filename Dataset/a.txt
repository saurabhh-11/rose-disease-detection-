A dataset for rose leaf diseases is currently available; 
however, it encompasses only a limited number of conditions, namely black spot, powdery mildew, and downy mildew. 
To address this gap, we have curated and created an extended dataset, which has been uploaded to Kaggle. 
Covering disease like rose rust,rose mosaic,rose slug.
